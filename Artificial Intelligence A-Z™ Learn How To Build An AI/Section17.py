# Section 17. 

# Annex 1 : Artificial Neural Networks.

'''
Deep Learning ->
Geoffrey Hinton - Godfather of Deep Learning. 
Mimic how the human brain operates. 
Artificial Neural Net. 
Input Layer, Hidden Layer, Output Layer. All connected to each other. 
Shallow Learning. 
Lot and lots of hidden layers - Deep Learning. 

Plan of Attack ->
Neuron, Activation Function, How Neural networks work, How Neural Networks Learn, Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent...
...Back-propagation.

Neuron ->
Basic Building Block of Neural Networks.
